    "# Working with data - challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains several programming challenges. These challenges are designed to cement your understanding of Python syntax and develop your ability to work with data effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should complete these challenges with a partner or as part of a small group, discussing and sharing potential solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenges increase in difficulty; you should start with the first challenge and work your way towards the end. You may need to do research outside this notebook to solve particular problems that you encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may find that some of these challenges are very difficult; this is by design. Struggling with complex problems is the best way to really learn how to program - even if you do not find the solution to a particular problem, you'll learn useful skills while looking for one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that one of the most important skills for any programmer is the ability to **research**. To solve these challenges, it's likely that you'll need to access outside resources, using search engines and other tools to find new information and syntax.  "
